# sprinkle-linode

An abstraction of the [Sprinkle](http://github.com/crafterm/sprinkle) scripts I use to set up a [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) environment on a Debian [Linode](http://linode.com), although it should work on any Debian 5.0 install.

## What does it install?

* apache
* git
* monit
* passenger
* postgres
* ruby
* gems
  * bundler

It can also copy over any virtual hosts you create in `assets/apache/sites`.

## Quick Start

1. Install sprinkle, if you do not already have it.
   <pre><code>gem install sprinkle</code></pre>

3. Now download or clone [sprinkle-linode](http://github.com/tristandunn/sprinkle-linode).
   <pre><code>git clone git://github.com/tristandunn/sprinkle-linode.git</code></pre>

4. Edit, rename, or remove the the configuration files in <code>./assets/</code>.

5. Copy `deploy.example.rb` to `deploy.rb` and edit the settings appropriately. For more details on possible options, see [Capistrano](http://www.capify.org/).
   <pre><code>cp deploy.example.rb deploy.rb</code></pre>

6. Finally run `install.rb` with `sprinkle`.
   <pre><code>sprinkle -c -s install.rb</code></pre>

7. Now grab a drink, sit back, and relax. It will install everything in around 15 minutes!
